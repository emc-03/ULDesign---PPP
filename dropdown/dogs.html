      <h3>DOG INFORMATION</h3>
      <h5> <em>On this page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
          stages of their lives.</em></h5>
      <p>Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and
        offers a diverse variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine
        Organization.<br> Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of
        loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved
        lipid profiles. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what
        you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. <br>

      <h4> Diet & Exercise</h4>
      <br>
      <h4><em>Puppy Care</em></h4>
      Puppies require special care, they should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day
      when they are about three to six months years old. <br> Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day
      when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. <br><br>
      <h4><em>General Diet</em></h4>
      A dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The <strong> ASPCA
      </strong>says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death,
      so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
      Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature.<br><br>
      <h4><em>Exercise</em></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day, depending on breed.</li>
        <p>Brisk Walks are a great way to exercise your dog!</p>
        <li>A variety of toys are encouraged for physical activity.</li>
        <p>Check for age recommendations so they do not pose a choking hazard. <br>Pay careful attention to toys that
          require supervision.</p>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4>Grooming & Handling</h4>
      <br>
      Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brush</strong> frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur.</li>
        <li><strong>Check </strong>for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bathing </strong>is not only important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise, especially for
          strong willed dogs. </li>
        <li><strong>Rinse </strong>all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash.</li>
        <p>Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. Be
          careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry
          your canine.<br><em> If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the
            forearm supporting the back half.<br> If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms
            perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.</em></p>

      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4>Vaccinations & Medications</h4>
      <br>
      You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically
      recommended.<br> Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus.
      Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides.
      <br>
      <lh><strong>Recommended Vaccines</strong></lh>
      <ul>
        <li> Bordetella bronchiseptica</li>
        <li>Borrelia burgdorferi</li>
        <li>Leptospira bacteria</li>
      </ul>
