      <h3>BIRD EDUCATION</h3>
      <p>
        <br>
        Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about two
        inches long and a little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich.<br> While most birds fly, there are
        some that don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes to their
        relational needs and well-being. Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like humans. A
        number of root causes may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness (either physical or
        mental), losing its companion, or increasingly becoming bored.
        <br><strong><em>Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing depression may include the following:
            <ul>
          </em></strong>
        <li>Reduced appetite</li>
        <li>Becoming increasingly irritable</li>
        <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
        <li>Songs have a different, more solemn tone</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong><em>Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms. Just like many illnesses,
          identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.</em></strong>

          <h3>FISH EDUCATION </h3>
      <br>
      Fish represent a broad class of aquatic animals that can live in fresh or saltwater, depending on the species.<br>
      Bringing fish into your home can be an exciting hobby, especially if you intend to breed them, and the presence of
      a fish tank in your home can induce feelings of peace and tranquility.

      Whether you are bringing your fish home for the first time or maintaining your aquarium, <em>it is important to test
      your water once per week to ensure it is free from toxins that can harm your fish.</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Freshwater Fish</h4>
      <br>
      There are several freshwater fish to choose from when setting up your aquarium, but it is best to consult with a
      “Pexpert” to ensure your fish will get along! No matter the species, ensure your fish are suited for a freshwater
      environment by investing in a water testing kit. Follow these general water chemistry guidelines to ensure your
      fish will adapt well to your aquarium and avoid ingesting toxins that can harm or kill your fish:
      • pH Level: 6.8–7.6 (7.0 is considered neutral)
      • Ammonia: any level above zero is harmful to fish
      • Nitrates: 5 to 10 ppm
      • Nitrites: less than 0.5 ppm
       <br>
       <br>
      <h4>Saltwater Fish</h4>
      <br>
      Saltwater fish also offer several options when it comes to choosing among species for your aquarium. 
      <br>As with
      freshwater fish,<strong> consult with a “Pexpert” </strong>to ensure your fish will get along are suited for a saltwater
      environment. <br>Following these general guidelines to avoid dangerous water conditions and ensure the appropriate
      salinity level for your fishies:
        <h5>Water Guidlines</h5>
      <ul class ="waterGuide" >
        <li><strong>Salinity:</strong> 1.020–1.028 sg</li>
        <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> 7.6–8.4 (7.0 is considered neutral)</li>
        <li><strong>Ammonia:</strong> any level above 0.1 ppm requires attention</li>
        <li><strong>Nitrates:</strong> 10 to 40 ppm</li>
        <li><strong>Nitrites:</strong> less than 0.2 ppm</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

    <h3>SMALL ANIMAL OWNERS CONTENT</h3> 
<br>
<p>Sometimes we want a pet in our life but think it’s impossible because we are not home enough to take care of it, or we don’t have enough room.
 Consider adopting a small animal such as a hermit crab, mouse, gerbil, hamster, guinea pig, or even a chinchilla!<br>
  Depending on which type of animal you adopt, you can provide a comfortable home:
  <br>
  <h5>Enviroment</h5>
  <h6>*Sizes may vary depending on animal size**</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Metal Cage</li>
    <li>Glass Cage</li>
    <li>Aquariums</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h5>Amenities for Pet</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Bedding/Substrate</li>
    <li>Toys</li>
    <li>Exercise Wheel</li>
    <li>Water Dish/Bottle</li>
    <li>Food Dish</li>

  </ul>
  <br>
